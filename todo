For now:
    ☐ replace "gatsbypress" with "wordsby" everywhere
    ☐ make menu, flexible content, and image components importable from wordsby
    ☐ add acf options endpoint
    ☐ fix wp menus
    ☐ fix wp theme styles
    ☐ convert bare site to use wordsby
    ☐ create starter
    ☐ test huge number of blog posts and images with wordsby and shared hosting
    ☐ create readme

For the future:
    ☐ create wordpress plugin that saves posts as markdown and commits them to the gatsby repo (basically the WP version of netlify cms)
